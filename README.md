# github-copilot-extension-aisearch

This repo is still a work in progress.
The initial code came from [this starter](https://github.com/raffertyuy/github-copilot-extension-python-azfunction-starter).

This repo is envisioned to integrate with Azure AI Search to be able to query custom data (and data from other file types) from GitHub Copilot Chat.
